# MIDAS_Data_Challenge
In this project, we use data collected from Walter P. Moore’s historical projects to model a project’s profitability with high precision, and also identify the metrics that are good predictors of the project’s profitability. We pre-process the data, conduct exploratory data analysis and perform feature engineering, then apply some classification algorithm based on our understanding of the data and the question. Models include Logistics Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost. We found XGBoost to have the best performance as well as strong interpretability. From the model inference, we are able to determine the important variables that are highly influential on the profitability of the projects, and we visualize it.
